I finally understood almost all of the DBNT code. I also read up about Gensim.

And, the big breakthrough - while I was trying to implement a k-nearest neighbour classifier for my paragraph vector model (in the hope of better accuracy), I found a glaring error in my implementation. Wait till the next post to know how the model performed after that error was fixed. (It takes that amount of time to run, right?)
