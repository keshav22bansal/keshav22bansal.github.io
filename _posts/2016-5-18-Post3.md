I finally found a way to deal with the iPython notebooks. In hindsight, well, that should have been easier.

So I went ahead and completed the first 4 assignments of the course, implementing a simple logistic regression-based classifier, a regularised classifier using stochastic gradient descent, and a classifer based on a convolutional network architecture. In the process, I learnt practical implementations of quite a few things involved in building a learning architecture using TensorFlow.
