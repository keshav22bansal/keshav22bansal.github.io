Corrected the errors on the Paragraph vector model and implemented it on the Imdb movie review dataset. I got an accuracy of 68.3% with 128-dimensional embeddings and 68.5% with 300-dim embeddings. 

I also learnt how to save and restore variable in TensorFlow, Numpy arrays and Python dictionaries, and put savers in my code, so that the training time is minimized in future experiments for the same dataset and embedding size.
