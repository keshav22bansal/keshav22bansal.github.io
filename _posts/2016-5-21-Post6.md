I have started reading up on ways to classify text. Read http://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.5882v2.pdf, which uses a ConvNet architecture for generating sentence embeddings for a movie review classification task. Read a sample implementation on TensorFlow (https://github.com/dennybritz/cnn-text-classification-tf). 

Also read https://cs.stanford.edu/~quocle/paragraph_vector.pdf, which generates paragraph vectors. Will try to implement this tomorrow. Also, read about Restricted Boltzman Machines (RBM) and Deep Belief Networks. Honestly, my hands are itching to write code. So I plan to do exactly that tomorrow.
