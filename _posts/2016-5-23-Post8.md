I got hold of the Large Movie Review Dataset, comprising of 50,000 labelled IMDb movie reviews with multiple (and often long) sentences. I made functions to build the dataset according to my needs, so that I could feed it into my paragraph vector classifier. I tried it for a small number of iterations, and thankfully, it was learning good word embeddings, though the paragraph embeddings are yet to be tested.
