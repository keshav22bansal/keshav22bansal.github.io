I arrived at the campus in the morning, and at the lab in the afternoon. Aadil and Vasu were not available, and thanks to the time difference, my late message was bound to attract even later replies. I had some idea about the project that I was going to work on, so I started revisiting deep neural networks via The Deep Learning Book (MIT Press).
