I ran my implementation of the paragraph vectors approach, and after five hours of waiting, I was in for a disappointment. The model couldn't achieve better than 52% accuracy, which is very poor. 

Frustrated, I searched for the most commonly used methods of document classification, which led me to Naive Bayes. I read about it, implemented my own simple classifier, and tested it on the Large Movie Review Dataset. Ha! It didn't do very well - just a 55% accuracy. 

Finally, I had a small chat with Aadil, wherein he recommended me to try running a toolbox on my computer, which I am going to do now.
