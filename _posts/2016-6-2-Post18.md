Wrote the code for an RSM using Tensorflow, and tried training it using the Imdb dataset. The weights and biases are going in a particular direction (so it is indeed training, I don't know if rightly), but the perplexity somehow comes out to be the same after every epoch. I'm still trying to figure out how that is possible.
