I ran the Deep Belief Net Toolbox (DBNT) that Aadil had suggested, and started reading up on how it works. In the process, I came across many terms that I didn't understand, so I searched for them and got a brief idea about some of them. Most notably, I read about Markov Chains, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, Gibbs Sampling and Contrastive Divergence. I also read about Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and was a little surprised as to how a Bag of Words model could do well in topic modeling. 

I plan to read and understand the code behind DBNT tomorrow.
