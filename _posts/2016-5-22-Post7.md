So, I set out to code a model for determining Paragraph Embeddings, as described by Mikolov et al. I successfully coded it up, but could not optimize the model, so the training accuracy was not much better than the trivial 50% on Movie Review (MR) database consisting of ~ 11,000 sentences with positive/negative labels. My model was overfitting, so I tried regularization too, but little change came about. Let's see. I am hoping to be able to build a better model soon.
