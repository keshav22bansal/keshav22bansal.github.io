It's tough to believe that it's already been a fortnight since I started the internship. The journey has been mostly exciting and learning intensive so far, and I hope the trend continues and improves.

I replaced my neural network classifier at the end of the paragraph vector model with a K-nearest neighbour setup, and achieved accuracies of 58%, 59%, 61%, 63%, 64%, 65%, 66%, 68%, and 68.3% with K = 1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 15, 21, 51, 101. So, this does not turn out to be a great classifier. I also experimented with TensorBoard, and visualized a graph of my model. 

Finally, I've also set up a Git repo for adding some of the stuff that I have coded up during the internship.
