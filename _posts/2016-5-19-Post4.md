Yay! I fully (almost) understood the skip-gram based word embedding model provided in the assignments of the course and implemented my own word embedding model using continuous bag of words (CBOW). 

I have started reading up on RNNs and LSTM. Hopefully, I would be able to understand them better by tomorrow.
